# Quiz Brain
A ten-question quiz game of easy history questions which takes its data through an API from OpenTrivia. I made the game originally 
as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" class on Udemy. I added the API 
request, JSON import, and the user's ability to choose difficulty and questions.

## Gameplay
Just start up the game and type "true" or "false" in response to the questions asked. Some grammatical mistakes exist from source.

### Future Improvements
* I would like the quizbrain to distinguish when it receives no questions into its question bank
