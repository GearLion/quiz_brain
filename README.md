# Quiz Brain 2.0: The GUI
Based on a project from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" class on Udemy. The
GUI version presents a window created in Tkinter where random questions from the OpenTrivia API populate in the center. 

## Gameplay
Just start up the game and the player can click the checkmark or crossmark buttons depending on whether he thinks the 
statement present is true or false. The screen will light up green if the player is correct or blink red if he is 
incorrect. The window also keeps track of total score.

### Future Improvements
* In the text-only version, the player could choose his topic and his difficulty level, and I would like to add that 
functionality to the GUI version as well.
