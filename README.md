# Quiz Brain
A ten-question quiz game of easy history questions which takes its data through an API from OpenTrivia. I made the game originally 
as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" class on Udemy. I added the automatic API 
request and the json import on my own.

## Gameplay
Just start up the game and type "true" or "false" in response to the questions asked. Some grammatical mistakes exist from source.

### Future Improvements
* I would like to add the ability to choose difficulty levels
* I would like to add the ability to pick the topic of the questions
