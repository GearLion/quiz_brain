# Quiz Brain
A ten-question quiz game of easy history questions which takes its data through an API from OpenTrivia.

## Gameplay
Just start up the game and type "true" or "false" in response to the questions asked. Some grammatical mistakes exist from source.

### Future Improvements
* I would like to add the ability to choose difficulty levels
* I would like to add the ability to pick the topic of the questions
